# Fleet-Tracking-and-Monitoring
Drone/Fleet real time location tracking

## Problem Statement

## Assumptions

Hardware Assumptions:
Each drone has Raspberry PI 3 with GPS module and 3G mobile dongle/other 3G module for cellular internet connectivity.
Drone simulation test module is created due to practical limitation to access GPS receivers and Microcontrollers for testing.

## Solution Overview

### Architecture

## Tech Stack
### Node.js -- server side scripting
### Socket.io -- real time location updates
### Angular and Google Maps for front end
### Resin.io for managing and deploying embeded systems
